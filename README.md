# Non-Cursor Based MiniPaint Java Program

A simple Java-based paint application built using Swing and developed in NetBeans.
This non-cursor-driven drawing tool lets users:

Draw and manipulate lines, circles, rectangles, and squares

Move, resize, delete, and colorize shapes

Save and load your canvas

All shape manipulation is done via GUI forms, not mouse dragging
